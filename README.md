This repository contains data and codes for reproducing the analysis presented in *SARS-CoV-2 Under a Suppress and Release Strategy in Hong Kong*.

The genomic sequences were not included in this repository according to GISAID [terms of use](https://www.gisaid.org/registration/terms-of-use/), instead, the GISIAD accession IDs of all consensus sequences used in this study were listed [here](./data/GISAID_accession_ID.csv). The detailed metadata of confirmed cases in Hong Kong cannot be shared, primary epidemiological data are freely available through the [official webpage](https://www.coronavirus.gov.hk/eng/index.html).

## The structure of this repository
The source codes for different analyses were stored in different sub-directories under the *scripts* directory. Related data are stored under the *data* directory. The results generated by the scripts can be found in the *results* directory.
