This repository contains data and codes for reproducing the analysis presented in *SARS-CoV-2 Under an Elimination Strategy in Hong Kong*.

The genomic sequences were not included in this repository according to GISAID [terms of use](https://www.gisaid.org/registration/terms-of-use/), instead, the GISIAD accession IDs of all consensus sequences used in this study were listed [here](./data/GISAID_accession_ID.csv). The primary epidemiological data of confirmed cases in Hong Kong are freely available via the [official webpage](https://data.gov.hk/en-data/dataset/hk-dh-chpsebcddr-novel-infectious-agent).

## The structure of this repository
The source codes for different analyses were stored in different sub-directories under the *scripts* directory. Related data which can be shared are stored under the *data* directory. The results generated by the scripts can be found in the *results* directory.

## Abstract
Hong Kong utilized an elimination strategy with intermittent use of public health and social measures and increasingly stringent travel regulations to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission. By analyzing >1700 genome sequences representing 17% of confirmed cases from 23-January-2020 to 26-January-2021, we reveal the effects of fluctuating control measures on the evolution and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Hong Kong. Despite numerous importations, only three introductions were responsible for 90% of locally-acquired cases, two of which circulated cryptically for weeks while less stringent measures were in place. We found that SARS-CoV-2 within-host diversity was most similar among transmission pairs and epidemiological clusters due to a strong transmission bottleneck through which similar genetic background generates similar within-host diversity.
